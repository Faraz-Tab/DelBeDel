# DelBeDel
The first draft repo for the DelbeDel project. 
This project is a webpage created for the purpose of testing an old persian saying "Del be Del Rah Dare", which roughly translates to hearts are connected. The projects aim is to track when and how often people are thinking about one another and give a report at the end of the day to the users. This report includes, how many times users have thought about one another and (the main goal) is to see if the timings of these thoughts can match one another and if subconscious thought can be connected if hearts are apart.
